Finding quickest way to pick in the warehouse

This program calculates shortest patch to the items that needed to be picked in the warehouse. This program was made by me to help new employees pick the most efficient way possible. 
Future goal is to implement it with Netsuite so when the picking sheet is printed, the items are sorted in order and by picking it in order, they are picking 
the item fast and efficiently.
